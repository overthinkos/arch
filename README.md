# overthinkos/arch

The **Arch Linux image family** for [OpenCharly](https://github.com/overthinkos/overthink),
split into its own repository and mounted as a git submodule at `box/arch`
of the main repo.

## What's here

| Kind | Entries |
|---|---|
| `image:` | `arch`, `arch-builder`, `cuda-arch-builder` (base/builder stack), `arch-coder`, `charly-arch`, `arch-test`, `vscode-test`, `arch-pacstrap-builder`, `arch-pacstrap` |
| `vm:` | `arch-pacstrap` (bootstrap), `arch` (cloud-image) |
| `deploy:` | `eval-arch-pacstrap-vm`, `eval-arch-vm` (+ nested `arch-host`, `charly-cachyos-tailscale-test`) |

## Composition — self-contained base, candies by reference

This submodule OWNS the Arch base/builder stack locally (the `arch` base, the
`arch-builder` multi-stage builder, and the CUDA-enabled `cuda-arch-builder`),
so every image's base is a bare local `arch` and **no namespace import is needed**.
The candy LAYERS are not vendored — each is pulled from the main repo by github
reference: `@github.com/overthinkos/overthink/candy/<name>:<tag>` in every box's
`candy:` list. The two arch-local test candies (`arch-pac-test`, `arch-aur-test`)
live under `candy/`.

All candy references pin to a single tag of the upstream repo, so a build is
reproducible. There is exactly one definition of every layer — no duplication.

## Build

```bash
# Inside the submodule (the build verb defaults to charly.yml):
charly box build arch-coder

# From the parent opencharly repo:
charly -C box/arch box build arch-coder

# Standalone, against the published repo:
charly --repo overthinkos/arch box build arch-coder
```

The first build resolves the upstream github references into
`~/.cache/charly/repos/` and materializes the referenced layers under
`.build/_layers/`.

## Requirements

A build of any image here fetches from the upstream repo, so it needs network
access and a `charly` recent enough to understand the config's schema version
(`charly` hard-fails with an "update charly" message if the config is newer than the
binary supports).
